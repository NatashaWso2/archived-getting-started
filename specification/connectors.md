# Connectors & Actions

Connectors represent participants in the integration. A `connector` is defined as follows:
```
[ConnectorAnnotations]
connector ConnectorName ([ConnectorParamAnnotations]TypeName VariableName[(, TypeName VariableName)*]) {
    ConnectorDeclaration;*
    VariableDeclaration;*
    ActionDefinition;+
}
```

Note that `ConnectorAnnotations` are designed to help the editor provide a better user experience for connector users.

A `connector` defines a set of actions. Actions are operations that can be executed against a connector. The  structure of an `action` definition is as follows:

```
[ActionAnnotations]

action ActionName (ConnectorName VariableName[, ([ActionParamAnnotations] TypeName VariableName)+]) (TypeName*)
        [throws exception] {
    ConnectorDeclaration;*
    VariableDeclaration;*
    WorkerDeclaration;*
    Statement;+
}
```

Connectors are instantiated (by means of the `new` keyword) as follows:
```
[ConnectorPackageName:]ConnectorName ConnectorInstanceName = new [ConnectorPackageName:]ConnectorName (ValueList[, map]);
```
The newly created instance has the `ConnectorInstanceName` assigned.

Once a connector of name `ConnectorInstanceName` has been instantiated, actions can be invoked against that connector as follows:
```
[ConnectorPackageName:]ConnectorName.ActionName (ConnectorInstanceName, ValueList);
```
