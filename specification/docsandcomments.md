# Documentation and Comments

Many programming languages treat documentation as an after thought with some languages using the approach of introducing structure to comments to insert structured documentation into the language.

Ballerina has a structured approach for both documentation and random comments which are not related to documenting per se but simply commenting about the logic of the program.

## Documenting with annotations

## Commenting Code

Any statement that starts with the characters `//` is a comment.


Comments are quite different in Ballerina in comparison to other languages. Comments are only allowed as a statement - i.e., only inside a resource, action, or function.
Ballerina has designed structured mechanisms via annotations to document all Ballerina outer level constructs (services, resources, etc.), and comments only play the role of providing a comment about the logic of a resource, action, or function.
